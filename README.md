# EEP153 Project 4: Team T.W. Schultz
## Topic
The objective of this project is to investigate the issue of nutritional adequacy in Nigeria, and to propose policies to address this concern. Our analysis of the dataset revealed significant nutritional deficiencies among the people of Nigeria, and we have developed policies to combat this issue. In this report, we will also compare our proposed policies with the current food policy in Nigeria. Our goals include:
* Conduct research into the current food situation in Nigeria to provide context for the project
* Utilize the LSMS survey dataset to examine demand and nutrition systems in Nigeria, with the aim of identifying nutritional deficiencies
* Develop policies to address the specific nutritional deficiency issue, focusing on the problem of Vitamin B deficiency
* Identify the challenges associated with implementing the proposed policies
* Compare the proposed policies with the current food policies in place in Nigeria
